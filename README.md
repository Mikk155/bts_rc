# Developer mode

These scripts does use of preproccesors for testing purposes
```C#
#if DEVELOP
    CLogger@ m_Logger = CLogger( "Randomizer" );
#endif

void myfn()
{
    ...

    #if DEVELOP
        m_Logger.debug( "{}: \"{}\" Swap position to {}", { name, ent_name, pRandomizer.GetOrigin().ToString() } );
    #endif
}
```

Sadly in AngelScript We can not define them.
```C#
#define DEVELOP
```
This doesn't work.

So to enable [loggers](scripts/maps/bts_rc/utils/Logger.as) and other features find all "``#if DEVELOP``" in the project with Visual studio code (or any IDE) and replace to "``#if SERVER``"
